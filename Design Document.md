Intention
To create a Telegram bot that summarizes group chat messages with customizable tones, saving users time with unread messages.
Structure
Bot Setup
Register the bot with Telegram’s BotFather to get an API token.

Use Python and the telebot library for Telegram interactions.

Message Handling
Listen to all incoming messages.

Store message content and chat IDs in a list or database, capped at a reasonable limit (e.g., 100 messages).

Command Handling
/last N: Summarize the last N messages in the chat’s set tone.

/tone TONE: Update the chat’s summary tone to TONE (stoic, chaotic, funny, deaf).

Summarization
Use a language model (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate summaries based on stored messages and the selected tone.

Tone Management
Store tone preferences per chat in a dictionary or database.

Default tone: “stoic.”

Project Rules
Documentation: Every file must start with a short description of its purpose for future AI reference.

Modularity: Split files or functions if they exceed 50 lines to improve context retention and performance.

Error Handling: Include try-except blocks for API calls and user inputs to prevent crashes.

Tone Options
Stoic: “Meeting scheduled at 3 PM. Task assigned to John.”

Chaotic: “3 PM meeting outta nowhere! John’s stuck with the task, lol.”

Funny: “A wild 3 PM meeting appears! John’s the chosen one.”

Deaf: “Meeting at 3 PM. John has task.”

Technology Stack
Python with telebot for Telegram API.

OpenAI API (or similar) for summarization.

In-memory storage (e.g., dictionary) for messages and tones, with optional database for persistence.

Structured Idea
Your Telegram bot will:
Join a group chat and monitor messages.
Summarize past messages with the /last N command, where N is the number of messages to summarize (e.g., /last 10 summarizes the last 10 messages).
Customize summary tone with the /tone TONE command, offering options like:
Stoic: Formal, concise, and informative (ideal for business chats).
Chaotic: Random, humorous, and slightly unpredictable (great for fun group chats).
Funny: Witty, entertaining, yet still informative.
Deaf: A literal, text-focused summary—interpreted as robotic and simplistic, ignoring implied emotions or subtext (your requested variable name).
Save time by providing quick, tone-adjusted summaries of unread messages.
Embellishments
The bot will store tone preferences per chat, defaulting to “stoic” if unset.
It will inform users it can only summarize messages sent after joining the chat (unless made an admin for broader access).
Summaries will be generated using a language model for quality and tone accuracy.

Potential Pitfalls and Solutions
Limited Message History Access
Problem: Telegram bots only see messages sent after they join a chat unless they’re admins.
Solution: The bot will notify users of this limitation. Optionally, make it an admin for older message access.
Summarization Quality
Problem: Capturing the right tone and meaning can be tricky, especially with quirky tones like “chaotic” or “deaf.”
Solution: Use a robust language model (e.g., GPT-4 via OpenAI API, or claude sonnet 3.7) and provide clear tone instructions.
“Deaf” Tone Ambiguity
Problem: “Deaf” is unclear in intent.
Solution: Interpret it as a robotic, literal summary focusing on text content, ignoring nuance to a comedic effect—e.g., “User1 said X. User2 said Y.”
Context Management
Problem: The AI needs enough message context for meaningful summaries.
Solution: Store recent messages (e.g., the last 100) per chat in memory or a database.
Performance
Problem: Summarizing many messages could slow the bot down.
Solution: Limit stored messages and optimize summarization calls.
