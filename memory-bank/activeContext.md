# Active Context - Para-Phrase Generator

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the implementation of the OpenAI Assistants API integration for the Para-Phrase Generator. We have successfully completed the core implementation, including:

1. Created an AssistantsManager class to handle assistant and thread management
2. Implemented a ThreadManager for message handling
3. Built a DelegationAssistant that orchestrates specialized assistants
4. Implemented message linking to original Telegram messages
5. Created specialized assistants for Twitter, Football, and Photo content
6. Updated the TelegramBridge to use the new architecture

Now we need to focus on testing and optimizing the implementation for production use.

### Recent Changes

1. **Integrated OpenAI Assistants API**
   - Created AssistantsManager and ThreadManager classes
   - Implemented thread-based communication between assistants
   - Added support for tool functions
   - Established a delegation pattern that follows the Assistants API best practices

2. **Implemented Message Linking Feature**
   - Created utilities for generating Telegram message links
   - Added a system to track and reference original messages in summaries
   - Implemented HTML link generation for Telegram

3. **Updated TelegramBridge**
   - Rewritten the TelegramBridge to use the Assistants API
   - Added proper async handling for commands
   - Implemented message storage and retrieval

4. **Updated Main Bot Implementation**
   - Modified bot.py to work with the new TelegramBridge
   - Added "processing" messages for better user experience
   - Improved error handling and logging

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Photo Processing**
   - Implement file upload and processing for photos
   - Connect the photo processing to the OpenAI image analysis

2. **Add Comprehensive Tests**
   - Create unit tests for the AssistantsManager and ThreadManager
   - Add integration tests for the delegation system
   - Test the message linking feature

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Improve response times for summarization
   - Add caching for assistant responses
   - Implement timeout handling for long-running requests

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update deployment scripts
   - Test in staging environment
   - Roll out to production

## Current Decision Context

- The OpenAI Assistants API is the preferred approach for building multi-agent systems
- All existing functionality has been maintained during the migration
- The message linking feature has been implemented as part of this update
- The transition has been done in a way that minimizes disruption to existing users
- We are following the latest best practices for the Assistants API
- Photo processing has been implemented using Telegram file IDs and OpenAI's vision capabilities

## Active Technical Considerations

- The Assistants API uses a thread-based model for communication
- File handling for photos has been implemented with direct API calls to OpenAI's vision model
- The Assistants API has built-in support for tool calling
- Streaming responses can improve user experience
- Error handling and retries are important for a robust implementation
- Message linking provides valuable context for users

## Current Focus: Testing and Optimizing the Assistants API Implementation

We have completed the implementation of the photo processing feature and are now focused on adding comprehensive tests and optimizing the performance of the system for production use. The core architecture is in place and working correctly, but we need to ensure it is robust and performant before deploying to production.
