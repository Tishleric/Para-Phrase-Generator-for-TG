# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the Para-Phrase Generator project, which uses the OpenAI Assistants API to provide a range of features through a Telegram bot interface. The core functionality includes:

- Message summarization and intelligent responses
- Image and link processing
- Real-time information retrieval via web search
- Sports information retrieval
- User profile management with vector database storage

We have completed the implementation of all core features and are now enhancing code quality, error handling, and ensuring proper documentation throughout the codebase.

## Recent Changes

- Improved error handling in the delegation process to provide better debugging information
- Enhanced Twitter API integration with proper environment variables
- Ensured web search tool is properly implemented using OpenAI's built-in capability
- Clarified the PhotoAgent implementation by removing confusing comments about Telegram tokens
- Updated the fetch_telegram_file function with better documentation and error handling
- Improved bot.py to provide detailed startup information and environment checks
- Updated .env.example with all necessary environment variables and documentation
- Enhanced the ImageAnalysisTool implementation with clearer documentation and functionality

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the system to production
2. Monitor performance and gather user feedback
3. Optimize response times and token usage
4. Consider adding more specialized assistants for different domains
5. Enhance user profile capabilities with more detailed information extraction

## Current Decision Context

- The OpenAI Assistants API is the preferred approach for this project due to its thread management and built-in tool support
- OpenAI's built-in web search tool is used instead of a custom implementation
- Image processing is done using GPT-4o for optimal results
- Message linking is always enabled to provide better context for users
- Error handling has been improved to ensure more robust operation

## Active Technical Considerations

- The Assistants API uses a thread-based model for maintaining conversation context
- ChromaDB is used for the vector store to maintain user profiles
- Web search capabilities provide real-time information retrieval
- Image processing is handled using GPT-4o
- The system uses a delegation pattern to route messages to specialized assistants
- Twitter API integration requires a bearer token for optimal functionality
- Environment variables are used for all configuration to support different deployment scenarios

## Current Focus

The current focus is on ensuring high code quality, proper error handling, and clear documentation before deploying to production. We've addressed several code clarity issues and improved error handling throughout the codebase. The system is now more robust and better documented for future maintenance.
