# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the Para-Phrase Generator project, which uses the OpenAI Assistants API to provide a range of features through a Telegram bot interface. The core functionality includes:

- Message summarization and intelligent responses
- Image and link processing
- Real-time information retrieval via web search
- Sports information retrieval
- User profile management with vector database storage

We have completed the implementation of all core features and created test scripts to validate functionality. The project is now ready for deployment.

## Recent Changes

- Created a comprehensive README.md with project documentation
- Developed a run.py script for easy deployment and error handling
- Updated requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- Created test scripts for vector store, Assistants API, and Profile Assistant
- Completed implementation of all core features
- Updated progress tracking in memory-bank

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the system to production
2. Monitor performance and gather user feedback
3. Optimize response times and token usage
4. Consider adding more specialized assistants for different domains
5. Enhance user profile capabilities with more detailed information extraction

## Current Decision Context

- The OpenAI Assistants API is the preferred approach for this project due to its thread management and built-in tool support
- All core functionality has been implemented and tested
- The system is ready for production deployment
- Future enhancements will focus on performance optimization and expanding capabilities

## Active Technical Considerations

- The Assistants API uses a thread-based model for maintaining conversation context
- ChromaDB is used for the vector store to maintain user profiles
- Web search capabilities provide real-time information retrieval
- Image processing is handled using GPT-4o
- The system uses a delegation pattern to route messages to specialized assistants

## Current Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the project for deployment. All core features have been implemented and tested. The system architecture is modular and extensible, allowing for future enhancements and optimizations.
