# Progress

This document tracks the current state of the project, including what has been completed, what remains to be done, and any known issues.

## What Works

1. **Core OpenAI API Integration**
   - Basic chat completion API calls ✅
   - Image analysis via Vision API ✅
   - Function calling capabilities ✅
   - Streaming responses ✅

2. **Agent Capabilities**
   - Basic agent creation and execution ✅
   - Multi-agent delegation architecture ✅
   - Custom function tools ✅
   - Web search tool integration ✅
   - Twitter/X link detection and processing ✅
   - Image analysis with GPT-4o ✅

3. **Assistants API Implementation**
   - Core Assistants API integration ✅
   - Thread-based communication ✅
   - Tool function implementation ✅
   - Delegation system using Assistants API ✅
   - Message linking to original Telegram messages ✅
   - Tone-specific assistants ✅

4. **Examples and Documentation**
   - Basic usage examples ✅
   - Agent architecture documentation ✅
   - Complex agent pipeline example ✅

## In Progress

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Testing the new Assistants API implementation
   - Updating tests to match the new architecture
   - Performance optimization

2. **Production Integration**
   - Connecting agent architecture to main application
   - UI for monitoring agent activities
   - Authentication and rate limiting

## Known Issues

1. **Photo Processing Not Fully Implemented (RESOLVED)**
   - The current implementation uses placeholder descriptions for photos
   - Resolution: Implemented proper photo processing using Telegram file IDs and OpenAI's vision capabilities

2. **Twitter Link Detection Issues (RESOLVED)**
   - The system had trouble detecting Twitter/X links in messages
   - Resolution: Enhanced regex patterns to better detect Twitter and X.com links, added support for t.co shortened URLs

3. **Image Processing Issues (RESOLVED)**
   - Image analysis wasn't working properly in the staging environment
   - Resolution: Updated the Photo Agent to use GPT-4o, implemented proper Telegram file_id handling

## Next Development Priorities

1. ~~Complete the photo processing implementation~~ (DONE)
2. Add comprehensive tests for the Assistants API implementation
3. Optimize performance for production use
4. Add monitoring and debugging tools
5. Deploy the updated system to production
